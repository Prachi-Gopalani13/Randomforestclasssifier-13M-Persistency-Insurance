Persistency 13M Payment Behaviour Prediction

## Problem Description:
Prepare a Machine Learning Model to predict the Persistency 13M Payment Behaviour at the New Business stage.

## Objective:
1. Using Machine Learning techniques, provide scores for each policy at the New Business stage the likelihood to pay the 13M premium.
2. Identify the segments where maximum non payers are captured

## Dataset:
1. “Training” & “Test” Dataset with the raw input attributes and the 13M actual paid/not paid flag.                                                                            
2. “Out of Time” Datasets would be provided with just the raw input attributes.

## Expected Steps:
1 Appropriate Data Treatments for e.g. Missing Value Imputation, Outlier treatment etc.                                                                                            
2. Feature Engineering for e.g. Binning, Ratio, Interaction, Polynomial  etc.                                                                                                      
3. Prepared a model on the Train Data and you can evaluate the generalization capability of your model by using K-Fold Cross Validation, Leave One Out Cross Validation or any other validation technique that you see appropriate.
